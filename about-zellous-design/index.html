        <p class="editable">10 years ago I began my foray into web design while working in the FDA's recruitment department. We had several web pages needing... help. With a slow computer and a desire to learn, I started improving the web pages.<br /><br />Fast forward 10 years: I now have a B.S. in Web Technology and Design, worked as an in-house marketer / designer for five years, and tackled numerous side projects. In 2015 I quit my job and started a web design company: Thus Zellous Design was born.<br /><br /><a class="social-icon" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/zellb"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a> <a class="hide social-icon" target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/u/6/104368762406327775945/about"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i></a> <a class="social-icon" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonz"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a></p>
